# Human Activities with Smartphone Sensors Classification Using Different Machine Learning Network Algorithms
📱🏃‍♂️💻
Smartphone-based human activity recognition is an emerging field of study that has a multitude of possible applications, such as monitoring health, tracking sleep patterns, and monitoring physical fitness. This study employed the UCI Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset to develop and assess machine learning algorithms capable of accurately classifying various human activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. We employed multiple machine learning techniques such as MLP, LVQ, and SVM to classify the activities, and evaluated their performance using various metrics. Additionally, we conducted novelty detection to identify any unusual behavior in the dataset and detect subjects with health problems or injuries.
