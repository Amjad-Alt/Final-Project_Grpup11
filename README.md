üì±üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

Smartphone-based human activity recognition is an emerging field of study that has a multitude of possible applications, such as monitoring health, tracking sleep patterns, and monitoring physical fitness. This study employed the UCI Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset to develop and assess machine learning algorithms capable of accurately classifying various human activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. We employed multiple machine learning techniques such as MLP, LVQ, and SVM to classify the activities, and evaluated their performance using various metrics. Additionally, we conducted novelty detection to identify any unusual behavior in the dataset and detect subjects with health problems or injuries.

## Result
Machine learning network algorithms such as MLP, LVQ and SVM can be used to accurately classify human activities by 94% - 92% based on accelerometer and gyroscope data that was collected from a smartphone. The application of these models in real-world scenarios will elevate the health sector, such as using them for health monitoring, sleep observing, and fitness tracking.
One limitation of the dataset used in this study is that it only includes data from 30 subjects, and it is not clear if the subjects have health problems or physical injuries. Therefore, the Novelty detection model One-class SVM model was not able to detect any anomalous subjects. We argue that the dataset may not be representative of the wider population. Additionally, the dataset only includes six different activities, which may not cover all the possible human activities. Future studies should consider including more diverse subjects and a wider range of activities to make the dataset more comprehensive and representative.
